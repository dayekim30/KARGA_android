Button -> to look up directory
          to read and write selected files
          file path = data/data/com.ops.text1/files/ ... 
          
Edit text -> to wirte command for running KARGA program

After running program
  the result csv files will be stored in download folder on emulator [device]


PROBLEM and ISSUE
When the file data is read and written by button operation, the data is distorted.

-> to run KARGA, upload mergares_full_database_v2.00.fasta and example.fastq in "data/data/com.ops.text1/files/ "
